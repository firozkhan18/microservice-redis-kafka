Event sourcing is a software architectural pattern that stores the state of an application as a sequence of events rather than as a single current state. Each event represents a state change that has occurred in the system. This approach provides a more detailed history of how an application reached its current state and allows for greater flexibility in managing state changes.

### Key Concepts of Event Sourcing

1. **Events**: Each state change is captured as an event. Events are immutable and represent facts about the past.
2. **Event Store**: Events are stored in an event store, which is a specialized database designed to handle event data.
3. **Rehydration**: The current state of an entity can be rebuilt by replaying the events in the order they occurred.
4. **CQRS**: Event sourcing is often used in conjunction with Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), which separates read and write operations to optimize performance and scalability.

### Advantages of Event Sourcing

- **Historical Record**: Provides a complete audit trail of all changes.
- **Rebuild State**: Allows you to reconstruct past states of the application.
- **Flexibility**: Enables new features and changes to be implemented without altering existing data structures.

### Example of Event Sourcing

Let’s illustrate event sourcing with a simple banking application where we manage accounts and transactions.

#### Domain Events

1. **AccountCreated**: An event indicating that a new account has been created.
2. **MoneyDeposited**: An event indicating that money has been deposited into the account.
3. **MoneyWithdrawn**: An event indicating that money has been withdrawn from the account.

#### Event Store

Each of these events would be stored in an event store:

```plaintext
1. AccountCreated(accountId: "123", owner: "Alice", initialBalance: 0)
2. MoneyDeposited(accountId: "123", amount: 100)
3. MoneyWithdrawn(accountId: "123", amount: 30)
```

#### Rehydrating State

To get the current state of the account with ID "123", you would replay the events in the order they occurred:

1. Start with an initial balance of 0 (from `AccountCreated`).
2. Add 100 (from `MoneyDeposited`).
3. Subtract 30 (from `MoneyWithdrawn`).

Current balance would be calculated as:

```plaintext
Initial Balance: 0
+ 100 (Deposit)
- 30 (Withdrawal)
= Current Balance: 70
```

#### Implementation Example in Pseudocode

Here’s how you might implement a basic event sourcing mechanism:

```java
class Account {
    private String id;
    private String owner;
    private List<Event> changes = new ArrayList<>();
    
    public Account(String id, String owner) {
        apply(new AccountCreated(id, owner, 0));
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        apply(new MoneyDeposited(id, amount));
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        apply(new MoneyWithdrawn(id, amount));
    }

    private void apply(Event event) {
        changes.add(event);
        if (event instanceof AccountCreated) {
            this.id = event.getId();
            this.owner = event.getOwner();
            this.balance = event.getInitialBalance();
        } else if (event instanceof MoneyDeposited) {
            this.balance += event.getAmount();
        } else if (event instanceof MoneyWithdrawn) {
            this.balance -= event.getAmount();
        }
    }

    public List<Event> getChanges() {
        return changes;
    }
}
```

#### Storing and Retrieving Events

When a change occurs (like a deposit or withdrawal), you would store the event in the event store. To retrieve the current state, you would load the events for that account from the store and replay them.

### Considerations

- **Complexity**: Event sourcing can introduce complexity, particularly in managing event schemas and versioning.
- **Eventual Consistency**: Asynchronous processing can lead to eventual consistency challenges, where reads may not reflect the most recent changes immediately.
- **Storage**: Event stores can grow large over time, requiring strategies for archiving or compacting events.

### Conclusion

Event sourcing is a powerful pattern that provides a clear history of changes, making it easier to understand and manage application state. By storing state changes as events, you gain flexibility and traceability, but it also requires careful design to handle complexity and data growth.
