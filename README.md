## Overview of Debezium
**Debezium** is described as a low-latency data streaming platform that facilitates Change Data Capture (CDC). Here's a breakdown of its key functionalities:

- **Monitoring Changes**: Debezium can monitor databases for row-level changes and allows applications to react to these changes without concern for transaction complexities or rolled-back changes.
- **Durable Logs**: It records changes in durable, replicated logs, enabling applications to process missed events upon restart, ensuring all events are handled accurately.
- **Unified Model**: It provides a consistent model for change events across different database management systems (DBMS), simplifying application development.

### Challenges Addressed
The document discusses common challenges in database change monitoring:
- **Complexity of Triggers**: Traditional database triggers can be cumbersome and are often limited to actions within the same database.
- **Lack of Standardization**: Different databases have various approaches to change monitoring, complicating integration and requiring specialized code.

---

## Architecture
### Core Design
Debezium utilizes **Kafka** and **Kafka Connect** to ensure durability, reliability, and fault tolerance. Here's how it works:
- **Connectors**: Each connector monitors a single database and captures changes, which are recorded in Kafka topics.
- **Ordered Events**: Kafka ensures that all events are ordered and replicated, enabling multiple clients to consume these events with minimal impact on the database.
- **Flexible Delivery**: Clients can choose between exactly-once or at-least-once delivery guarantees, and all events are delivered in the order they occurred.

### Embedded Connectors
For applications that do not require Kafka's overhead, Debezium offers an embedded connector engine that allows connectors to run directly within the application, bypassing Kafka.

## Common Use Cases
Debezium is useful in various scenarios:
1. **Cache Invalidation**: Automatically updating or invalidating cache entries when underlying data changes.
2. **Monolithic Application Simplification**: Reducing complexity in applications that perform multiple updates by decoupling these actions into separate processes triggered by database changes.
3. **Inter-Application Communication**: Allowing multiple applications to be aware of each other's changes without direct dependencies.
4. **Data Integration**: Synchronizing data across multiple systems, especially in ETL scenarios.
5. **CQRS**: Supporting the Command Query Responsibility Separation pattern by capturing changes in a durable manner for processing across multiple read models.

## Building Debezium
### Requirements
To build Debezium locally, several tools are required:
- **Git**: For version control.
- **JDK**: Java Development Kit, specifically version 17 or later.
- **Docker**: Required for running integration tests with various external systems.
- **Apache Maven**: A build tool used to manage project dependencies and build the project.

### Docker Utilization
The document explains the rationale behind using Docker:
- **Ease of Environment Setup**: Developers do not need to manually install and configure multiple services.
- **Consistent Builds**: Ensures that all developers have the same environment, leading to consistent results.
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Docker containers are ephemeral, simplifying testing and avoiding leftover states from previous runs.

### Build Instructions
Instructions are provided for cloning the repository, building the project using Maven, and verifying that all necessary tools are installed. There are also options to skip integration tests if Docker is not available.

### Testing Various Connectors
Specific commands are provided for running tests for different database connectors (e.g., PostgreSQL, Oracle, MongoDB) using various configurations and dependencies.
